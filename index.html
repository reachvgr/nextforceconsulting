<p>Methodology:</p>

<p>We adhere to a rigorous methodology that ensures the implementation of all necessary processes and quality checks, with a high-level focus on metrics in every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>

<p>Let's delve into the key phases:</p>

<p>Requirements Gathering: The requirements gathering phase is of paramount importance. During this phase, our business analysts and project managers actively engage in meetings with clients to gather their specific requirements. Based on inputs from product backlog, sprint backlog, customer feedback, and stakeholder input, we define the requirements for each iteration.</p>

<p>Analysis: Once the requirements gathering phase is complete, our experienced Business Analysts (BAs) convert the business requirements into technical requirements. Collaborating with senior team members, such as subject-matter experts (SMEs) and team leads, the BAs document the technical requirements in a comprehensive Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.</p>

<p>Design: The design phase involves translating the requirements from the SRS into a detailed design plan called the Design Document Specification (DDS). Our skilled developers leverage the SRS to create rough designs, working models, and specify various aspects of the software, such as control flow, user interface, architecture, platforms, programming, communications, and security. This phase also encompasses the overall system architecture design, defining the functionality of each module and its interaction with cross-systems.</p>

<p>Development/Construction: Once the DDS is approved, the development phase commences. Our developers adhere to rigorous coding standards while programming and utilize programming tools for compilation and debugging to ensure error-free code. This phase involves developers at all levels, and the resulting code is documented as the Source Code Document (SCD). The responsibilities of our developers include coding, compilation, and ensuring the integrity of the source code.</p>

<p>Testing/Quality Assurance: Following the completion of coding, the code undergoes rigorous testing to verify its functionality. The initial testing, including unit testing (UT) and/or Application Integration Testing (AIT), is performed by the developers before handing over the code to the dedicated testing team. Once the code is migrated to the testing environment, our testing team conducts various tests, including quality testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and approval testing. Thorough testing is carried out in accordance with the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) to ensure the proper functioning of each component or module.</p>
